Projects: Customer Segmentation
In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers into distinct groups based on personal attributes such as age, gender, location, hobbies, and other characteristics. By clustering customers with similar behaviors and traits, the goal was to help businesses better understand their clientele and offer personalized products, services, and marketing strategies.
In this I utilized K-Means clustering for grouping customers into meaningful segments.
Applied performance metrics like Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Calinski-Harabasz Index to evaluate the quality of the clusters.
The project enables businesses to make data-driven decisions, optimizing marketing efforts and improving customer experience by targeting specific groups more effectively.
